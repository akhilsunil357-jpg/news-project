    <p>Air pollution levels across several major Indian cities have worsened in recent weeks, with dense smog and high particulate matter affecting daily life. Cities like Delhi and nearby regions are witnessing reduced visibility, rising respiratory problems, and increased health advisories, especially for children and the elderly. Experts warn that vehicle emissions, construction dust, industrial pollution, and seasonal factors are major contributors, and they stress the urgent need for stronger pollution-control measures and public awareness to protect long-term health.</p>
    <p>The main causes of this crisis include vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, construction dust, crop residue burning in nearby states, and unfavorable weather conditions that trap pollutants close to the ground. Authorities have implemented emergency measures such as restricting construction work, limiting vehicle movement, and advising people to avoid outdoor activities during peak pollution hours.</p>
    <p>Health experts warn that prolonged exposure to polluted air can lead to serious problems such as asthma, lung infections, heart disease, and reduced immunity, especially among children, the elderly, and people with existing health conditions. They emphasize the need for long-term solutions like cleaner energy, better public transport, and stricter enforcement of pollution-control laws to prevent future crises.</p>
