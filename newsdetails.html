    <p>Lionel Messi, the Argentine football legend, concluded his highly anticipated GOAT Tour of India 2025, visiting multiple cities including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi. During the tour he interacted with thousands of fans, participated in cultural events, and thanked India for its “warm hospitality” — calling the experience unforgettable and expressing hope for a bright future for Indian football.</p>
    
    <p>The trip wasnt without controversy: a chaotic event in Kolkata saw overcrowding and frustrated fans protesting after Messis brief appearance, prompting authorities to detain an organiser and issue official apologies.</p>
    
    <p>Messi also made headlines with a special visit to Vantara, a wildlife rescue and conservation centre in Jamnagar, where he participated in traditional rituals and engaged with wildlife care staff — later sharing touching moments that resonated deeply online.</p>
