    <p>On December 19, 2025, Indian stock markets saw a broad-based rally as key benchmarks climbed higher, driven by positive global cues following softer-than-expected inflation data from the United States. The U.S. consumer price index for November rose by 2.7% year-on-year, below economists’ expectations of around 3.1%, prompting investors to increase bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in 2026. This boosted risk appetite across Asian equities and lifted investor sentiment on Dalal Street. As a result, India’s flagship indices, the Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex, moved up, with gains seen across major sectors including pharmaceuticals, financials, and IT stocks, while mid-cap and small-cap shares also participated in the rally. Foreign portfolio investors returned as net buyers in domestic equities, adding to the upward momentum. The positive shift in global market expectations and potential for lower interest rates abroad made Indian equities more attractive to investors, supporting the broader market’s upswing.</p>
    <p>The rally was broad-based, with major sectors such as banking, IT, pharmaceuticals, and metal stocks witnessing buying interest. IT stocks performed well as hopes of lower U.S. interest rates could improve demand from overseas clients. Mid-cap and small-cap stocks also participated in the uptrend, indicating improved risk appetite among domestic and foreign investors. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were seen returning as net buyers, adding strength to the market.</p>
    <p>Market experts said that easing inflation in the U.S. could improve global liquidity conditions, which is positive for emerging markets like India. A stable outlook for interest rates, coupled with strong domestic fundamentals, is expected to support Indian equities in the near term. However, analysts advised investors to remain cautious and watch upcoming global economic data and central bank signals, which could influence market direction further.</p>
